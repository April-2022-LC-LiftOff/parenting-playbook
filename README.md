# Parenting Playbook Repo

## 🔹 Overview 🔹

This project is a resource for parents to identify potential interventions and solutions to executive functioning concerns (e.g. issues with organization, staying on task, self-monitoring, self-management, etc.).

Users have the opportunity to create accounts, find potential low-level interventions based on a person's specific situation and needs, and add interventions to a database that other users can access.

Logged in users can leave comments or rate interventions based on efficacy and share interventions with others.

Users can also search for interventions based on student need without making an account.

## 🔹 Features 🔹

1. User login- Users will create accounts to login to the application and will have a profile page.
2. Choose a domain- Users can select one of eight executive functioning domains to learn more about it.
3. Click for list of interventions- Users can click on a domain to be taken to a list of "things to try" to address executive dysfunction.
4. Add/Create- Users will be able to create interventions to add to the database for other users to access.
5. Leave feedback on interventions- Users will be able to comment on interventions or rate them for their efficacy.

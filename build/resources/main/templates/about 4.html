    <p style="text-align: center;">
        This project is a resource for parents to identify potential interventions and solutions to executive functioning concerns
        (e.g. issues with organization, staying on task, self-monitoring, self-management, etc.).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Users have the opportunity to create accounts, find potential low-level interventions based on a person's specific situation and needs,
        and add interventions to a database that other users can access.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Logged in users can leave comments or rate interventions based on efficacy and share interventions with others.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Users can also search for interventions based on student need without making an account.

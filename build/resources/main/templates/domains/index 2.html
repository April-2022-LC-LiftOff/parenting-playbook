                        Self-control is being able to “stop and think” before making a choice or
                        completing an action. Difficulties with self-control may look like interrupting, blurting out,
                        saying or doing things impulsively, and challenges with determining how their actions will
                        impact others in the moment.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Emotional control is the ability to self-regulate one’s emotions. Difficulties with emotional
                        control may look like screaming, tantrumming, lashing out, crying frequently, changing emotions
                        quickly (going from '0 to 100' quickly), and an inability to determine the size of a problem.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        The ability to “go with the flow” and adapt to situations by changing the plan or strategy.
                        Difficulties with flexible thinking may look like rigidity, unable to cope with changes in
                        routine, anxiety when plans change, and refusal to try other strategies when their strategy is
                        not working.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Working memory is a person’s ability to retain information so they can complete a task.
                        Difficulties with working memory may look like an inability to follow multiple step directions,
                        forgetting directions immediately after hearing them, struggles with following the steps to
                        completing an assignment, and forgetting what others have said.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Self-monitoring is a person’s ability to check in on themselves and evaluate how they are doing
                        in the moment. Difficulties with self-monitoring may include becoming easily distracted,
                        struggles with or an inability to complete a task, getting off topic while working on an
                        assignment, and not demonstrating age appropriate learning behaviors (e.g. working quietly,
                        staying on the assignment/web page, etc.).
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Planning and prioritizing/Time Management are the mental processes that allow people to make a
                        plan of action and stick to it. Difficulties with planning and prioritizing/time management may
                        look like being often too late or too early to events, inability to intuitively plan out how
                        long something will take to complete, unable to keep or follow a to-do list in order of
                        priority, and struggling with identifying the steps to complete a task in a logical order.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Task initiation is the ability to start a task, stick with it, and avoid procrastination.
                        Difficulties with task initiation may look like procrastinating, saying 'I don't know where to
                        start', getting side-tracked or easily distracted, and difficulties with sitting down and
                        getting to work.
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        Organization is the ability for a person to create or utilize systems to manage their
                        belongings and thoughts. Difficulties with organization may look like having piles of items that
                        aren't put away, cluttered areas or a messy desk/bedroom, thoughts and writing are shared out
                        of order, unable to independently create and maintain organizational systems, and struggles with
                        understanding how to keep a space organized and neat.

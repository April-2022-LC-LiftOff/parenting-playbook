Visual Cues for Self Regulation;Visual cues are incredibly helpful for neurodivergent children. Visual supports for self-regulation may include an image of a stop light or stop sign,  list (written or pictures) of calming strategies,  rules and expectations,  feelings charts,  emotional thermometer,  etc.;Your child will use the visual as a reminder to stop and think before making an unexpected choice.;Some pre-made visuals can be found here: https://www.earlywood.org/Page/549 ;Use this in combination with other self-regulation strategies.;1;0
Role Playing: Impulse Control;Role playing is a fun and powerful tool for teaching impulse control. Children learn best when they are given opportunities to practice their impulse control,  and working on those skills in a controlled environment with a trusted adult and/or peer is ideal. Think of situations in which your child struggles to demonstrate impulse control. Prior to role playing,  tell your child the expected behavior in a given situation (e.g. At the grocery store,  you shouldn’t run away from me.) Then,  act out the situation and have your child demonstrate the skill of staying by you. Provide positive praise when your child engages in the expected response. Practice with multiple scenarios over multiple sessions.;Your child will demonstrate impulse control in a situation in which they did not show impulse control in the past.;You can find some example scenarios here: https://www.thecognitivecoach.org/copy-of-cognitive-kids ;Try to pair role playing with a preferred reinforcer (e.g. special treat,  extra video game time,  hug,  etc.) when the child engages in the expected response.;1
Teach body clues;Some neurodivergent children struggle to understand their emotions. They may feel an emotion but struggle to differentiate between anger,  excitement,  etc. Sometimes,  they don't realize they are feeling a strong emotion until it is too late to cool down. Teach your child to pay attention to their body clues. Talk to your child about anger (or sadness, excitement,  fear,  etc.) and talk about the inside/internal body clues they experience and write them down. Do they feel a lump in their throat? Do their legs feel weak? Does their stomach feel tight? Etc. Discuss how our bodies feel when we have big emotions. Remind your child that it’s okay to experience a big emotion,  but that when they notice these body clues,  it's a signal that it's time to stop and think of a calming strategy to use.;Your child will be able to identify the way their body feels when they experience a variety of emotions.;https://www.compassionatecounselingstl.com/blog/emotional-expression-activity-identification-for-kids;Immediately after your child calms down from feeling a big emotion,  have a conversation about how their body felt and write it down for them. In time,  your child will see that they are experiencing the same body clues each time they have a big emotion.;1
Reinforcement;Everyone likes to earn things for doing a good job! Reinforce your child with positive verbal praise and/or tangible items when they engage in the ability to stop and think. Not all children are interested in earning the same rewards,  and sometimes the rewards kids want to earn change quickly. Try to give a preference assessment to your child (or just ask them!) about what they would like to earn if they demonstrate impulse control,  emotional regulation,  etc. Then provide the reinforcer (paired with verbal reinforcement) when they engage in the expected response. Eventually you can fade back on giving tangible reinforcers because your child will have learned to associate your verbal praise with positivity.;Your child will eventually be able to follow expectations.;Ideas for reinforcement: https://www.verywellfamily.com/positive-reinforcement-child-behavior-1094889    Preference assessment example: https://www.mayinstitute.org/pdfs/presentations/PBIS2019-T-A3C-Preference%20Assessment%20Packet.pdf ;Reinforcement takes time and won't work immediately. Stick with it,  and give preference assessments quickly. Pair the biggest wins with the biggest reinforcers and smaller wins with smaller reinforcers.;1
Play self control games;Self-control games are a fun way to practice impulse control! Games such as Simon Says and Red Light-Green Light are perfect for practicing control.;Your child will have fun practicing self-control.;More ideas: https://www.counselorkeri.com/2019/11/04/games-to-teach-kids-self-control/ ;Try to pair the game with reinforcement for demonstrating self-control.;1

You can change things to make it work for your child! Perhaps they would like to listen to relaxing music or use positive affirmations as a part of their routine.;2
Calming strategies;Children who struggle with emotional regulation benefit from being explicitly taught strategies for calming down. Teach your child multiple ways of calming down, and then write each calming strategy you practice together on a list. Have the list readily available so your child can reference it the next time they are upset. This works best when your child practices strategies regularly-- at least once a day. ;Your child will be able to identify a calming strategy that helps them when they are feeling overwhelmed or upset.;This site has 75 strategies for kids: https://parentswithconfidence.com/calm-down-strategies-for-kids/ ;Not every strategy will work every time.

Make the list small- 5 or fewer strategies.;2

Calm down zone;Repurpose an area of your home to be a calm down space when your child is dysregulated.

Play tents and forts work well!;Your child will access their calm down space and use the tools to help them self-regulate.;How to make a quiet area in your home: https://www.kindercare.com/content-hub/articles/2020/may/home-sensory-spaces-kids ;Talk with your child to see how the space can be more comfortable and preferred for them.
